<Web Development 3 - Final Project Proposal>

1. Project Title: 
"Shopping Cart Cookbook App"

2. Introduction: A brief description of the app, and its purpose.
I want to create a basic shopping cart app where users can add/remove items to their shopping list, then I want to build an additional feature that tells the user what recipe their shopping list can cook using this Free Meal Prep API (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

3. Features and Functionality:
	-List and describe the core features of your app.
	-Explain any unique functionality or interaction.
>Signup/Login
	-everyone can save their personal shopping list to their private account securely
>Add/Remove shopping list items to a table with basic CRUD functionality.
>Bonus Button that brings up a table of all the dishes that can be cooked with the current User's shopping list.
	-If you click on a dish, a more detailed window containing all the cookbook intructions will get displayed.

4. List the Models your API will serve (one MUST be a user, choose two more):
	-Describe the journey a user will take through your app from start to finish.
>Models: User, ShoppingList, RecipeBook
>The journey a user will take through my Restful Web API application: Login/Signup Page --> ShoppingList CRUD functional --> Window gets updated with recipe names (click for full recipe) that the User's current ShoppingList can cook thanks to the utilization of the Free Recipe API.
